            <h2 class="post-title">What are your activities/habits that negatively or positively affect the environment?
            </h2>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>The activities that I always or usually do that affects the environment positively is
                recycling. One of the most effective ways to make a positive impact on our environment
                is recycling, it is accessible and simple yet powerful activities that contributes to our
                natural habitat and sustainability of the environment. Recycling materials such as papers,
                plastic, and even metal can help reduce the pollution that we are facing today. In addition,
                recycling also helps to reduce the waste, conserving and minimizing the resources that we
                are going to use. Furthermore, recycling also leads to composting organic waste to create
                nutrient soil amendments that can be used for our agriculture. I also consider the habit of
                following rules and regulations in terms of putting the garbage into the right place,
                whether its biodegradable or non-biodegradable. These rules protect our habitat and
                biodiversity, preventing negative activities that can result to destruction of our
                environment. Applying our education to help the environment can make our daily life
                easier, creating healthy and more sustainable world for the future generations Following
                and embracing these habits can help to protect, restore, and preserve our environment.

                On the other hand, I’m trying my best to stay away from activities that can harm our
                environment. But for me, the only thing that is keeping me from that is the usage of water.
                Water is a resource that is significant to help our environment, it can affect our
                environment positively and negatively, depends on how we use it. Excessive usage of
                water can have negative impacts for our economy and environment, it can lead to water
                scarcity, soil problems, water quality and etc. Reduced water usage can help the health of
                the life of aquatic ecosystems, energy savings, and lowering our bills. In order to protect
                our environment, correct practices to have a responsible water usage is a must, it is crucial
                for ensuring that our resource remains available for the future generations and for the
                environment.

            <h2 class="post-title">How can you help in saving Mother Earth?
            </h2>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>How can we save Mother Earth? This is one of the most popular questions that is
                important to have an explanation and an answer. We can save Mother Earth by simply
                following the rules to have healthy environment. We also need to protest to protect our
                nature to the people that are doing illegal, such as illegal logging, illegal mining, illegal
                fishing, and killing wildlife animals. Practicing to conserve energy consumption is also
                important, by turning off the lights or any appliances when not in use has a big impact.
                Plastic use is one problem that the people and animals are facing, minimizing the usage of
                single use plastics, and choosing reusable items is a must to fight plastic pollution.
                Participating in environmental activities like clean ups and tree planting in your community
                can also help the environment to become clean and avoid large flooding, the flow of water
                can be controlled if clean drainages and rivers are implemented. By adopting these simple
                habits/activities, we can encourage ourselves and others to do the same, we can make a
                change and positive impact on the environment if more people will do this practices, that
                can show the Mother Earth’s natural beauty.

            <h2 class="post-title">In what way technology may be used in saving and protecting the environment?</h2>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Technology is crucial in protecting and saving the environment, it makes our work to help
                sustaining the environment easier. One of the most common and the most effective way
                of using technology is using social media to raise awareness about the state of our
                environment. Nowadays, social media has the most potential and powerful thing to have
                an environmental advocacy, it can provide a large set of information and sources that is
                essential to spread to different kinds of platforms. Solar Panels is also one invention that
                proves the technology is important in environment. Solar Panels are helping to conserve
                energy by absorbing the radiation of the sun to create a renewable energy, reducing our
                usage on fossil fuels that destroying our environment, and maintaining the climate change.
                Solar panel doesn’t have a negative impact since there is no air and water pollution making
                it eco-friendly to the surroundings and the people. As technology becomes more advance
                and accessible, it can help our life easier and safer for the planet.
                In conclusion, technology plays an important role in shaping our environment more cleaner
                and greener. We are facing the challenges with the help of technology, for waste
                reduction, monitoring, and prediction of our weather, and etc. Embracing our technology
                to develop eco-friendly inventions is one of the key to build a harmonious natural world.
